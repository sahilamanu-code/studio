# **App Name**: KashFlow

## Core Features:

- Collection Input Form: A form for cleaners to input their daily cash collections, with fields for the cleaner's name, site, date, car plate, amount of cash collected, and any relevant notes.
- In-Hand Cash Display: Automatically calculate and display the amount of cash each cleaner should have in hand, based on the pending list data and their collection inputs. This tool will identify the cleaner by Site Name and Cleaner Name (from Pending List)
- Deposit Recording: A section in the app where cleaners or supervisors can record bank deposit information, including the date of deposit, amount deposited, and a field to upload a photo of the deposit slip.
- Cash Reconciliation: Automatically reconcile the cash in hand with the deposits recorded, highlighting any discrepancies or overages. Provide an overall balance.
- Data Import: Allow cleaners/supervisors to upload the daily pending list (either via CSV/Excel or copy-pasting the data), with automatic parsing to update the In-Hand Cash Tracking feature. App attempts to recognize data like cleaner's name, plate and cash from any provided list, as a tool.
- Local Data Storage: Store collection entries, deposit records, and the pending list data locally.
- Operations Dashboard: A dashboard accessible to operations heads, displaying the amount of cash each cleaner has in hand, with alerts for those exceeding the 3-day or 5000 Dirhams limit.
- Data Editing: For the MVP, allow checkers to change the values of data updated in one place. Later, password access can be added to restrict access to editing certain areas.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate cyan (#46878F), reminiscent of accounting ledgers.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#E0F4F5), visibly close in hue to the primary color, but far less saturated for a calm feel.
- Accent color: Deep yellow-green (#7A9F42), for actionable elements; analogous to the primary color but distinctly different in brightness and saturation to make those elements stand out.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for a modern, neutral, professional, and objective feel.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear section headings and labels.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for navigation and actions.
